# Organizing Inventory - Department Store Manager Challenge

This Java program helps a department store manager organize and summarize inventory data from multiple store branches. Each branch is identified by a unique code, and the program calculates the total number of products available per store.

## üßæ Problem Description

You're the new manager of a department store chain and need to organize the product inventory. Each store has a unique code, and you must calculate the total number of products available in each one.

### ‚úÖ Input

A string containing store codes and product quantities, separated by commas. Each store and quantity is represented in the format:

```
storeCode:quantity
```

Example:

```
LOJA1:10,LOJA2:5,LOJA1:3
```

### üßæ Output

A string showing each store code and the total quantity of products available, in the format:

```
storeCode:total
```

Stores must appear in the same order as their **first appearance** in the input.

Example Output:

```
LOJA1:13,LOJA2:5
```
